# CKPS Constraint Classification

CKPS is FinanceFlo's framework for classifying the primary constraint preventing a business from scaling effectively. Every business has one dominant constraint — identifying it correctly determines the intervention strategy, recommended tier, and priority AI applications.

## C — Capacity Constraint

**Definition**: The business has more demand than it can fulfil with current resources. Growth is limited by headcount, processing capacity, or throughput bottlenecks.

Signs:
- Finance team working overtime consistently
- Month-end close taking 10+ working days
- Backlog of invoices, reconciliations, or reports
- Hiring freezes despite growing workload
- Manual processes that don't scale with transaction volume

AI Solution Focus:
- Automation of high-volume, repeatable tasks (AP/AR processing, reconciliations)
- Intelligent document processing to reduce manual data entry
- Automated reporting to eliminate spreadsheet assembly time
- Workflow automation for approvals and routing

Recommended Tier: **Transform** or **Accelerate** — these businesses need automation to unlock capacity without proportional headcount growth.

Typical ROI: 40-60% reduction in manual processing time, enabling 2-3x volume handling with the same team.

## K — Knowledge Constraint

**Definition**: The business lacks the expertise or insight to make optimal decisions. Data exists but isn't being used effectively.

Signs:
- Decisions made on gut feel rather than data
- Finance team skilled in bookkeeping but not strategic analysis
- No predictive capabilities (cash flow forecasting, demand planning)
- Reliance on external consultants for analysis
- Difficulty interpreting financial data for non-finance stakeholders

AI Solution Focus:
- AI-powered analytics and dashboards for real-time insight
- Predictive models (cash flow, revenue, churn)
- Natural language reporting for non-technical stakeholders
- Automated anomaly detection and alerting
- AI assistant for ad-hoc financial queries

Recommended Tier: **Accelerate** or **Partner** — these businesses need AI to augment decision-making capability.

Typical ROI: 20-35% improvement in forecast accuracy, faster decision cycles, reduced consulting spend.

## P — Process Constraint

**Definition**: The business has the people and knowledge but inefficient processes create waste, errors, and delays.

Signs:
- Multiple systems with manual data transfer between them
- Inconsistent processes across departments or entities
- High error rates requiring rework
- Lack of standardised workflows
- Audit findings related to process gaps

AI Solution Focus:
- Process redesign with ERP (Sage Intacct) as the backbone
- Integration platform (iPaaS) to connect systems
- Standardised workflows with AI-powered exception handling
- Quality control automation
- Process mining to identify hidden inefficiencies

Recommended Tier: **Transform** — these businesses need process re-engineering before AI can be maximally effective.

Typical ROI: 50-70% reduction in process errors, 30-50% faster cycle times, significant audit risk reduction.

## S — Scale Constraint

**Definition**: The business has outgrown its current systems and processes. What worked at a smaller scale is now breaking down.

Signs:
- ERP or accounting system reaching capacity limits
- Multi-entity or multi-currency challenges
- Consolidation taking days or weeks
- Compliance requirements increasing with growth
- System performance degradation

AI Solution Focus:
- Modern ERP implementation (Sage Intacct) with multi-entity architecture
- Automated consolidation and intercompany transactions
- AI-powered compliance monitoring at scale
- Scalable data architecture with real-time reporting
- Advanced analytics for complex, multi-dimensional analysis

Recommended Tier: **Accelerate** or **Transform** — these businesses need infrastructure that scales before layering AI on top.

Typical ROI: Foundation for 3-5x growth without proportional cost increase, 80%+ reduction in consolidation time.

## Constraint Interaction

Most businesses have a primary constraint and one or two secondary constraints. The AIBA diagnostic identifies the primary constraint through weighted scoring, but the implementation plan addresses all identified constraints in priority order.

Common combinations:
- **Capacity + Process** — inefficient processes create artificial capacity constraints
- **Knowledge + Data** — poor data quality prevents effective analysis
- **Scale + Process** — growth exposes process weaknesses
- **Capacity + Knowledge** — team too busy doing to learn or analyse
