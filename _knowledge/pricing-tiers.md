## How We Recommend Tiers

The AIBA diagnostic automatically recommends a tier based on:
1. **Overall score** — lower scores suggest more comprehensive transformation (Tier 2)
2. **Primary constraint** — Scale constraints typically need Tier 2; Knowledge constraints may suit Tier 3
3. **Business size** — larger organisations with complex requirements lean toward Tier 2
4. **Existing technology** — modern ERP already in place suggests Tier 3
5. **Budget alignment** — Cost of Inaction is compared against tier pricing to demonstrate ROI

## Key Differentiators

- **Not just ERP implementation** — AI-first approach with ERP as the data foundation
- **Measurable outcomes** — every engagement includes baseline metrics and ROI tracking
- **Industry expertise** — deep knowledge of financial services, construction, healthcare, and professional services
- **Ongoing partnership** — not a one-off project, continuous optimisation
- **Connected Intelligence** — proprietary methodology combining ERP, AI, and integration into a unified platform
