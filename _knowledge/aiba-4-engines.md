# AIBA 4 Engines Framework

The AI Business Analyst (AIBA) diagnostic engine evaluates businesses across four critical operational dimensions. Each engine represents a core area where AI can drive measurable transformation.

## 1. Revenue Engine

The Revenue Engine analyses how effectively a business generates, tracks, and optimises income. Key areas include:

- **Revenue recognition accuracy** — automated tracking against ASC 606 / IFRS 15 standards
- **Billing cycle efficiency** — time from service delivery to invoice, collection rates
- **Pricing optimisation** — AI-driven dynamic pricing based on market conditions and customer segments
- **Forecasting accuracy** — ML-based revenue forecasting vs. spreadsheet-based methods
- **Customer lifetime value (CLV)** — predictive models for retention and upsell opportunities

A low Revenue Engine score (below 40) indicates significant revenue leakage, manual billing processes, or poor forecasting that costs the business 15-30% of potential revenue.

## 2. Operations Engine

The Operations Engine measures process efficiency, automation levels, and operational resilience:

- **Process automation rate** — percentage of repeatable tasks handled by AI/automation
- **Error rates** — manual data entry errors, reconciliation discrepancies
- **Cycle times** — month-end close duration, reporting turnaround
- **Resource utilisation** — staff time on value-add vs. administrative tasks
- **System integration** — data flow between platforms, manual handoffs

Businesses scoring below 40 on Operations typically spend 60%+ of finance team time on manual tasks that AI could automate.

## 3. Compliance Engine

The Compliance Engine evaluates regulatory readiness and risk management:

- **Audit readiness** — time to prepare for external audit, completeness of documentation
- **Regulatory compliance** — adherence to industry-specific regulations (FCA, HMRC, SEC)
- **Internal controls** — segregation of duties, approval workflows, exception handling
- **Data governance** — data quality, retention policies, GDPR/POPIA compliance
- **Risk scoring** — AI-powered risk assessment for transactions and counterparties

A compliance score below 40 puts the business at significant regulatory risk and audit exposure.

## 4. Data Engine

The Data Engine assesses information quality, accessibility, and analytical capability:

- **Data quality score** — completeness, accuracy, consistency across systems
- **Real-time visibility** — access to live financial data vs. batch/delayed reporting
- **Analytical maturity** — descriptive → diagnostic → predictive → prescriptive analytics
- **Single source of truth** — unified data model vs. siloed spreadsheets
- **Self-service reporting** — ability for stakeholders to access insights without IT dependency

Organisations with a Data Engine score below 40 are making decisions on incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate information.

## Scoring Methodology

Each engine is scored 0-100 based on weighted assessment responses:
- **0-25**: Critical — requires immediate intervention
- **26-50**: Below average — significant improvement opportunities
- **51-75**: Average — targeted enhancements recommended
- **76-100**: Strong — optimisation and advanced AI applications

The overall AIBA score is the weighted average across all four engines, with weighting adjusted based on the business's primary constraint type (CKPS classification).
