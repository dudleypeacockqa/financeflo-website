# ADAPT Methodology Guide

ADAPT is FinanceFlo's proprietary implementation methodology for AI-powered financial transformation. It provides a structured, risk-managed approach to moving businesses from manual, fragmented financial operations to intelligent, automated systems.

## Phase 1: Assess (Weeks 1-3)

**Objective**: Understand the current state and quantify the opportunity.

Activities:
- AIBA diagnostic across all 4 engines (Revenue, Operations, Compliance, Data)
- CKPS constraint classification to identify the primary bottleneck
- Current-state process mapping of key financial workflows
- Technology audit of existing systems and integration points
- Stakeholder interviews to understand pain points and priorities
- Cost of Inaction (COI) calculation — quantifying what doing nothing costs annually

Deliverables:
- AIBA Score Report with engine-by-engine breakdown
- Current-state process maps
- Cost of Inaction analysis
- Prioritised opportunity matrix

## Phase 2: Design (Weeks 4-6)

**Objective**: Architect the target state and create the transformation roadmap.

Activities:
- Future-state process design incorporating AI automation opportunities
- Technology stack recommendation (Sage Intacct configuration, AI tools, integrations)
- Data migration strategy and mapping
- Integration architecture (iPaaS design with IntelliFlow where applicable)
- Change management plan for staff transition
- ROI projection with phased benefits realisation

Deliverables:
- Solution architecture document
- Implementation roadmap with milestones
- Detailed ROI model
- Risk register and mitigation plan

## Phase 3: Architect (Weeks 7-10)

**Objective**: Build the foundation and configure core systems.

Activities:
- Sage Intacct environment setup and configuration
- Chart of accounts design and multi-entity structure
- AI model training on business-specific data
- Integration development (ERP ↔ banking, CRM, payroll)
- Custom reporting and dashboard build
- User acceptance testing (UAT) preparation

Deliverables:
- Configured Sage Intacct environment
- Working integrations
- Custom reports and dashboards
- UAT test scripts

## Phase 4: Pilot (Weeks 11-14)

**Objective**: Validate in production with a controlled rollout.

Activities:
- Parallel run of old and new systems
- Data migration execution with validation
- Staff training (role-based, hands-on)
- AI automation activation in supervised mode
- Performance monitoring and tuning
- Issue resolution and process refinement

Deliverables:
- Successful parallel run results
- Trained user base
- Go-live readiness assessment
- Cutover plan

## Phase 5: Transform (Weeks 15+)

**Objective**: Full deployment and continuous optimisation.

Activities:
- Full system cutover
- Decommission legacy systems
- Advanced AI feature activation (predictive analytics, anomaly detection)
- Continuous improvement programme
- Quarterly business reviews with ROI tracking
- Phase 2 AI opportunities identification

Deliverables:
- Fully operational system
- Post-implementation review
- Ongoing optimisation roadmap
- ROI realisation tracking

## Key Principles

1. **Quick Wins First** — Identify and deliver tangible value within the first 4-8 weeks
2. **Data Quality Foundation** — Clean, reliable data before AI automation
3. **People Before Technology** — Change management is as important as technical implementation
4. **Measure Everything** — Baseline metrics → progress tracking → ROI validation
5. **Iterative Delivery** — Small, frequent releases rather than big-bang deployment
