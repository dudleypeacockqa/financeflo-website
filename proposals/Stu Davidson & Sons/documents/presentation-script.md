# Presentation Script — Stu Davidson & Sons (Pty) Ltd
## AI Business Analysis Proposal | FinanceFlo.ai

**Presenter:** Dudley Peacock, FinanceFlo.ai
**Audience:** Stuart Davidson (Director), co-directors, Lisa (Finance/Admin Manager), Ashley Bezuidenhout (Accountant), Chris (IT/Technical)
**Duration:** ~20 minutes + 10 minutes Q&A
**Setting:** Board-level presentation — directors seeing this material for the first time. Lisa, Ashley, and Chris attended the initial discovery meeting.
**Tone:** Direct, evidence-based, respectful. Speak as a peer consultant, not a vendor. Construction directors value plain language, numbers, and proven results.

## SLIDE 1 — Title Slide

> Good morning/afternoon, everyone. I'm Dudley Peacock from FinanceFlo.ai.
>
> Stuart, directors — thank you for making the time. I know your schedules are tight, so I'll keep this focused and practical.
>
> Lisa, Ashley, and Chris were generous enough to spend 45 minutes with me walking through how Stu Davidson & Sons operates day to day — the systems, the processes, the pain points. Everything you're about to see comes directly from that conversation. This isn't a generic pitch. It's built around your business.

## SLIDE 2 — About FinanceFlo.ai

> A quick word on who we are. FinanceFlo.ai specialises in one thing: helping growing, multi-entity businesses transform their financial operations using AI and modern ERP systems — specifically Sage Intacct.
>
> We're not a software reseller. We're consultants who diagnose where your business model breaks at scale, and then design solutions around those constraints. AI is a tool in our toolkit — not the starting point.
>
> We work across construction, agriculture, manufacturing, and professional services. The common thread is always the same: multi-company groups that have outgrown their accounting systems.

---

## SLIDE 3 — Meeting Recap

> So here's what we covered. I met with Lisa, Ashley, and Chris and we went through the full group structure — the 12 companies, the plant hire and construction core, the aircraft division, the property companies, and the mining entity.
>
> The big picture: you're running 10 separate Sage Pastel Partner instances for 10 companies. That means 10 separate logins, 10 separate backups, 10 separate year-end processes. No consolidated view across the group.
>
> Your team was very clear about one thing — and I want to address it upfront because I know it matters: **Whimbrel stays.** I completely respect that. Your team has spent eight years building it, it runs your operations, and it's a genuine competitive advantage. Nothing I'm proposing replaces Whimbrel. Everything I'm proposing makes the world *around* Whimbrel work better.
>
> *(Pause — let the Whimbrel acknowledgment land. This builds trust with the directors.)*

---

## SLIDE 4 — Constraint Diagnosis

> Now, this is the part I think you'll find most valuable. We don't come in and ask "What do you want to automate?" That's the wrong question. We ask: "Where does your business model break at scale?"
>
> Based on what your team shared, we've identified four constraints:
>
> **Process.** Ten separate Pastel instances means every intercompany transaction is manual. Every consolidation is manual. Every year-end is a project in itself. That's not a technology problem — it's a structural one.
>
> **Knowledge.** Your aircraft division is running on paper job cards. Ashley described it as "very paper heavy." When a mechanic retires or moves on, that maintenance knowledge walks out the door. For aircraft, that's not just inefficient — it's a compliance risk.
>
> **Scale.** Ashley mentioned data integrity issues in your bigger company. Pastel Partner has a known database size limitation — around 3 to 4 gigabytes. Once you hit that, records start degrading. You're already seeing this. If your volume doubles, this gets significantly worse.
>
> **Capacity.** Information lives in five different places: Whimbrel, Pastel, spreadsheets, WhatsApp, and email. Your team spends time hunting for information instead of using it. That's a capacity drain that doesn't show up on any report.

---

## SLIDE 5 — Cost of Inaction

> Now I want to put some numbers to this. These are conservative estimates based on industry benchmarks for multi-entity construction businesses of your scale.
>
> We estimate the status quo is costing you somewhere between **R85,000 and R145,000 per month**. That's the manual processing overhead, the revenue leakage from delayed invoicing, the duplicate entry errors, and the early payment discounts you can't capture because you don't have real-time cash visibility across all twelve entities.
>
> Annualised, that's over **R1 million to R1.7 million per year**.
>
> I'm not saying this to create urgency artificially. I'm saying it because when we look at the investment options in a moment, I want you to have context. This isn't a cost — it's a reallocation. You're already spending this money. The question is whether you're getting any return on it.
>
> *(Pause here. Let the silence after the number do the work. Don't rush past this slide.)*

## SLIDE 6 — Quick Wins Identified

> Even before a full analysis, our initial conversation revealed four high-impact opportunities:
>
> **One** — replace the ten separate Pastel instances with a single Sage Intacct environment. One login, real-time consolidation, automated intercompany. This is the big structural change.
>
> **Two** — digitise the aircraft job cards. A simple mobile app for the hangar mechanics. They photograph the work, tap a few fields, and you've got a searchable digital history for every aircraft. Ashley mentioned adoption might be a challenge for the mechanics — we design for that.
>
> **Three** — put an AI layer on top of Whimbrel. Imagine asking "What was our fuel cost per hour on the N2 project last month?" and getting an instant answer. No spreadsheets, no digging. Whimbrel stays exactly as it is — we just make it smarter.
>
> **Four** — automated data cleanup across your databases. Fix the duplicates, the misspellings, and set up rules so they don't come back.

---

## SLIDE 7 — AIBA Framework Overview

> So how do we get there? This is our AI Business Analysis framework — the AIBA. It's a structured 10-week engagement designed to map every constraint, quantify the ROI, and give you a prioritised implementation roadmap.
>
> Five pillars:
>
> **Assess** — understand your current state, map every process, identify every bottleneck.
>
> **Integrate** — design how your systems should talk to each other. Whimbrel to Sage Intacct. Aircraft records to a central database.
>
> **Build** — architect the solutions. Not build them yet — architect them. So you know exactly what you're investing in before a single line of code is written.
>
> **Analyse** — quantify the impact. ROI projections, payback periods, risk assessments. The business case your board needs.
>
> **Transform** — the roadmap. Prioritised projects, timelines, budgets, and a 12-week action plan so you know exactly what happens after the AIBA is complete.

---

## SLIDE 8 — AIBA 10-Week Timeline

> Here's how the 10 weeks break down:
>
> **Weeks 1 to 3** — we gather and train. Kick-off meeting with your key people, a baseline questionnaire, a full tech stack review. We also run two AI awareness training sessions. This is important — we want your team to understand what AI can and can't do, so they're part of the solution, not resistant to it.
>
> **Weeks 4 to 7** — we go deep. Department by department. Finance, operations, the aircraft division, procurement, HR. We map every process, identify every bottleneck, and quantify the impact.
>
> **Weeks 8 to 10** — we deliver. A comprehensive AIBA report with strategic recommendations, a prioritised project roadmap, a timeline and budget breakdown, and a 12-week action plan.
>
> For your business specifically, the AIBA will focus on multi-company consolidation, Whimbrel integration, aircraft maintenance digitisation, and construction operations optimisation. It's not generic — it's built around your constraints.

---

## SLIDE 9 — Investment Options

> Three options, and they're designed to be sequential — you don't have to commit to everything upfront.
>
> **Option one — the AIBA itself.** R85,000 to R175,000, depending on complexity and scope. This is where I'd recommend starting. It gives you the full picture, the prioritised roadmap, and the business case you need to make informed decisions. No guesswork.
>
> **Option two — Quick Wins Sprint.** Scoped directly from the AIBA findings. We implement the top two or three highest-ROI items in four to eight weeks. This is where you prove value fast.
>
> **Option three — Ongoing Advisory.** R30,000 to R75,000 per month. A fractional Chief AI Officer engagement. Continuous optimisation, system health monitoring, and strategic execution.
>
> I want to be clear — all pricing is indicative and on a time-and-materials basis. We'll provide a detailed statement of work with fixed milestones before anything starts. No surprises.
>
> *(Note: Do not mention hourly rates unless directly asked. If asked: "Consultant R975/hr, Senior Consultant R1,850/hr, excl. VAT.")*

---

## SLIDE 10 — Next Steps

> So here's what I'd suggest:
>
> **Step one** — take some time with this document. Discuss it internally. Lisa, Ashley, and Chris can fill in the context from our meeting.
>
> **Step two** — when you're ready, let's schedule a 45-minute discovery call with all decision-makers present. No obligation. We'll answer every question and help you decide if the AIBA is the right next step.
>
> **Step three** — if it makes sense for both sides, we kick off the AIBA. Week one starts with a kick-off meeting and baseline questionnaire. By week ten, you'll have a comprehensive roadmap.
>
> One thing worth noting on timing: Lisa mentioned you're planning a Pastel cloud migration at the end of March. Before you invest in migrating ten separate Pastel instances to the cloud, it's worth understanding whether consolidating to a single Sage Intacct environment would be more cost-effective and future-proof. The AIBA will give you that clarity.
>
> Stuart, directors — I genuinely believe there's a significant opportunity here to transform how Stu Davidson & Sons operates financially. Not by replacing what works, but by making everything around it work better.
>
> I'm available anytime. Let's open it up for questions.

## Q&A PREPARATION — Anticipated Questions

| Likely Question | Recommended Response |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "What happens to Whimbrel?" | "Whimbrel stays. We integrate around it — AI query layer on top, data flows into Sage Intacct for financial consolidation. Your operations system doesn't change." |
| "How accurate is AI?" | "Great question — Chris raised this too. We build in human-in-the-loop validation. AI suggests, humans approve. Full audit trail on every change." |
| "Why not just migrate Pastel to the cloud?" | "You could, but you'd be migrating 10 separate instances to the cloud — same fragmentation, just hosted differently. Consolidation to one system is the structural fix." |
| "What's the ROI?" | "The AIBA will give you precise numbers, but based on our initial analysis, the Cost of Inaction is R85k–R145k/month. Even a 30% reduction pays for the AIBA in the first month." |
| "Can we start smaller?" | "Absolutely. The AIBA itself is the smallest meaningful starting point. It gives you the roadmap without committing to implementation. Think of it as due diligence." |
| "How do you handle the aircraft division?" | "We'd digitise the job cards with a simple mobile app — camera-based, minimal typing. We design for adoption, especially for non-desk workers. Ashley flagged this as a concern and we'll address it in the AIBA." |
| "What about data security?" | "All data stays in your environment or in Sage's ISO 27001 certified cloud. We sign NDAs before any engagement. The AIBA includes a security and compliance review." |

## DELIVERY NOTES

- **Pace:** Speak at 80% of normal speed. Directors are busy but this needs to land.
- **Names:** Use their names — "Stuart," "Lisa mentioned," "Ashley described," "Chris asked" — personalisation builds trust.
- **Whimbrel:** Say it early, say it clearly, say it respectfully. This is the make-or-break moment.
- **Cost of Inaction:** Don't rush. Let the silence after the number do the work.
- **Close:** Warm, not pushy. "When you're ready" not "Let's book this week."
- **Body language:** Lean forward during constraint diagnosis. Open hands during investment options. Steady eye contact during the close.
