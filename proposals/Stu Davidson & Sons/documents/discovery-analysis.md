**Analyst:** Dudley Peacock, FinanceFlo.ai
**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Framework:** GOTCHA Sales Methodology + ATLAS-VM

## GOTCHA Methodology Application

### G — Gap (Constraint Identified)

Four constraints were identified during the discovery meeting, mapped to the ATLAS-VM diagnostic framework:

| Constraint Type | Description | Severity | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process** | 10 separate Pastel Partner instances; no consolidated group view; manual intercompany; painful year-end | High | Confirmed by all three attendees |
| **Knowledge** | Paper-based aircraft maintenance records; tribal knowledge at hangar; no digital history | Medium-High | Ashley described in detail; CAA compliance risk |
| **Scale** | Pastel Partner data integrity degradation in larger entity (3–4 GB limit) | Medium | Ashley confirmed ongoing issues |
| **Capacity** | Manual data capture across Whimbrel, Pastel, spreadsheets, WhatsApp, email; no single source of truth | Medium | Implicit throughout conversation |

### O — Opportunity (ROI Quantified)

**Five ROI Levers Applied:**

| Lever | Application | Estimated Annual Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time Saved** | Eliminate manual re-keying across 10 Pastel instances; automate intercompany; reduce month-end close | R300,000–R480,000 |
| **Error Reduction** | Fix data integrity issues; eliminate paper-based aircraft records; standardise data entry | R180,000–R360,000 |
| **Throughput Increase** | Finance team freed from data entry to focus on analysis and decision support | R180,000–R240,000 |
| **Risk Avoidance** | CAA compliance for aircraft records; audit trail for financial transactions; data integrity protection | R120,000–R240,000 |
| **Visibility Gain** | Real-time consolidated group reporting; cross-entity dashboards; AI-powered business intelligence | R240,000–R420,000 |
| **Total Estimated Annual Value** | | **R1,020,000–R1,740,000** |

### T — Transformation (Solution Presented)

The proposed transformation follows the ADAPT Framework with three core components:

1. **Sage Intacct Multi-Company Financials** — replace 10 Pastel instances with one consolidated cloud platform
2. **Whimbrel Integration** — API-based connection between operational and financial systems
3. **AI Layer** — ML for transaction automation, Agentic AI for business intelligence, RL for continuous improvement

Quick-win pilot: **Aircraft Digital Job Card System** (low risk, clear ROI, small user group, does not touch Whimbrel or Pastel).

### C — Commitment (Engagement Secured)

**Current status:** Warm — gatekeepers engaged, directors not yet involved.

**Engagement path:**
- Phase 1: AI Operations Audit (R45,000–R175,000) — recommended starting point
- Phase 2: Quick Wins Sprint (scoped from audit)
- Phase 3: Ongoing Strategic Partnership (R30,000–R75,000/month)

**Barriers to commitment:**
- Directors absent from meeting; they control budget and final decision
- Lisa cautioned: "Don't go and build models and whatever yet"
- Whimbrel is non-negotiable — any solution must integrate, not replace
- "Change is sometimes slow" — cultural resistance to rapid transformation

### H — Handoff (Delivery Plan)

Delivery follows the 9-step implementation model if the engagement proceeds:

1. Stakeholder mapping (including directors)
2. Current-state process mapping (all 12 companies)
3. Whimbrel API assessment
4. ROI stack with specific levers
5. Architecture blueprint (Sage Intacct + Whimbrel integration)
6. Implementation and data migration
7. UAT with Lisa, Ashley, Chris
8. Full deployment with training
9. Handoff with playbooks and transition to retainer

### A — Acceleration (Scale Plan)

Once the core financial platform is operational:
- Extend AI layer to mining operations
- Add property management modules
- Implement directors' capital company automation
- Scale Agentic AI across all 12 entities
- Continuous reinforcement learning for process optimisation

## Stakeholder Power Map

| Stakeholder | Influence | Interest | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Directors** (absent) | Very High — budget authority, final decision | Unknown — one approved the meeting | Equip gatekeepers with compelling evidence; offer to present directly |
| **Lisa** | High — gatekeeper to directors, pragmatic | High — wants better systems but cautious | Respect her pace; provide evidence-based materials; let her control the narrative to directors |
| **Ashley** | Medium — operational knowledge, finance expertise | High — sees the pain daily | Provide technical detail; address adoption concerns; show how mechanics can use mobile apps |
| **Chris** | Medium — IT/technical, evaluates feasibility | Medium-High — curious about AI accuracy | Address Human-in-the-Loop; provide technical architecture; demonstrate auditability |
| **Whimbrel developers** | Medium — integration feasibility depends on them | Unknown — not yet contacted | Lisa to investigate API availability; critical path item |
| **Hangar mechanics** | Low — end users, adoption risk | Low — paper works for them currently | Design for simplicity; demonstrate time savings; involve in UAT |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Directors reject the proposal | Medium | High | Provide compelling COI data; offer low-risk audit as starting point; let gatekeepers present |
| Whimbrel has no APIs | Medium | High | Prepare alternative integration methods (database connectors, file exchange); assess during audit |
| User adoption resistance (hangar) | Medium | Medium | Design simple mobile interface; involve mechanics in design; demonstrate time savings |
| Budget constraints | Medium | Medium | Phase the engagement; start with audit only; prove ROI before larger investment |
| Pastel cloud migration creates competing priority | Low-Medium | Medium | Position Sage Intacct as the better alternative to Pastel cloud; timing advantage |
| Scope creep across 12 entities | Medium | Medium | Start with core plant hire + aircraft; expand only after proven success |

## Unanswered Questions (For Follow-Up)

1. **Whimbrel architecture:** Is it multi-tenant? What technology stack? Are APIs available or planned?
2. **Directors' priorities:** What are the directors' specific concerns about change? What would convince them?
3. **Budget parameters:** Is there an annual IT/systems budget? What was spent on Whimbrel development?
4. **Compliance requirements:** Are there specific SARS, CIPC, or industry compliance requirements driving urgency?
5. **Growth plans:** Is the fleet expanding? New geographies? Acquisitions planned?
6. **Current pain frequency:** How often do data integrity issues occur? What is the re-work cost?
7. **Aircraft regulatory:** What specific CAA requirements apply? Are there upcoming audits?
8. **Intercompany complexity:** What types of intercompany transactions occur? How are they currently handled?
