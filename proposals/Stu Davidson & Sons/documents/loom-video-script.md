# Loom Video Script — Stu Davidson & Sons Proposal Walkthrough

**Duration:** ~8 minutes
**Audience:** Stuart Davidson and co-directors (primary), Lisa, Ashley, Chris (secondary — they've already met you)
**Tone:** Warm, direct, no-nonsense. Speak like a peer, not a salesperson. Construction directors respect plain language and evidence.
**Recording tip:** Screen-share the proposal webpage and walk through each section. Face cam on throughout.

## INTRO — Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

> Hi Stuart, directors — Dudley Peacock here from FinanceFlo.ai.
>
> First off, thanks for giving your team the green light to meet with me. Lisa, Ashley, and Chris were brilliant — really open, really honest about what's working and what's not. That kind of transparency is rare and it tells me a lot about the culture you've built.
>
> I've put together this discussion document specifically for Stu Davidson & Sons. This isn't a generic pitch — everything you're about to see is based on what your team told me about your operations, your systems, and where things get difficult.
>
> I'll walk you through it in about eight minutes. If nothing else, I think you'll find the constraint diagnosis interesting — it might put some numbers to things you already feel intuitively.

## SECTION 1 — Meeting Recap (0:45 – 1:45)

*[Scroll to the Meeting Recap section]*

> So here's a quick summary of what we covered. I met with Lisa, Ashley, and Chris for about 45 minutes. We went through your full group structure — the 12 companies, the plant hire and construction core, the aircraft division, the property companies, and the mining entity.
>
> The big picture: you're running 10 separate Sage Pastel instances for 10 companies. That means 10 separate logins, 10 separate backups, 10 separate year-end processes. No consolidated view across the group.
>
> Your team was very clear about one thing — and I want to address it upfront because I know it matters to you: **Whimbrel stays.** I completely respect that. Your team has spent eight years building it, it runs your operations, and it's a genuine competitive advantage. Nothing I'm proposing replaces Whimbrel. Everything I'm proposing makes the world *around* Whimbrel work better.

## SECTION 2 — Constraint Diagnosis (1:45 – 3:15)

*[Scroll to the Constraint Diagnosis section with the visual]*

> Now, this is the part I think you'll find most valuable. We don't come in and ask "What do you want to automate?" — that's the wrong question. We ask "Where does your business model break at scale?"
>
> Based on what your team shared, we've identified four constraints:
>
> **First — Process.** Ten separate Pastel instances means every intercompany transaction is manual. Every consolidation is manual. Every year-end is a project in itself. That's not a technology problem — it's a structural one.
>
> **Second — Knowledge.** Your aircraft division is running on paper job cards. Ashley described it as "very paper heavy." When a mechanic retires or moves on, that maintenance knowledge walks out the door. For aircraft, that's not just inefficient — it's a compliance risk.
>
> **Third — Scale.** Ashley mentioned data integrity issues in your bigger company. Pastel Partner has a known database size limitation — around 3 to 4 gigs. Once you hit that, records start degrading. You're already seeing this. If your volume doubles, this gets significantly worse.
>
> **Fourth — Capacity.** Information lives in five different places: Whimbrel, Pastel, spreadsheets, WhatsApp, and email. Your team spends time hunting for information instead of using it. That's a capacity drain that doesn't show up on any report.

## SECTION 3 — Cost of Inaction (3:15 – 4:15)

*[Scroll to the Cost of Inaction section]*

> Now, I want to be upfront — these numbers are estimates based on industry benchmarks for multi-entity construction businesses of your scale. They're conservative.
>
> We estimate the status quo is costing you somewhere between R85,000 and R145,000 per month. That's the manual processing overhead, the revenue leakage from delayed invoicing, the duplicate entry errors, and the early payment discounts you can't capture because you don't have real-time cash visibility across all twelve entities.
>
> I'm not saying this to create urgency artificially. I'm saying it because when you look at the investment options in a moment, I want you to have context. This isn't a cost — it's a reallocation. You're already spending this money. The question is whether you're getting any return on it.

---

## SECTION 4 — Quick Wins (4:15 – 5:00)

*[Scroll to the Quick Wins section]*

> Even before a full analysis, our initial conversation revealed four high-impact opportunities:
>
> **One** — replace the ten separate Pastel instances with a single Sage Intacct environment. One login, real-time consolidation, automated intercompany. This is the big one.
>
> **Two** — digitise the aircraft job cards. A simple mobile app for the hangar mechanics. They photograph the work, tap a few fields, and you've got a searchable digital history for every aircraft.
>
> **Three** — put an AI layer on top of Whimbrel. Imagine asking "What was our fuel cost per hour on the N2 project last month?" and getting an instant answer. No spreadsheets, no digging.
>
> **Four** — automated data cleanup across your databases. Fix the duplicates, the misspellings, and set up rules so they don't come back.

---

## SECTION 5 — The AIBA Framework (5:00 – 6:30)

*[Scroll to the AIBA Framework section]*

> So how do we get there? This is our AI Business Analysis framework — the AIBA. It's a structured 10-week engagement designed to map every constraint, quantify the ROI, and give you a prioritised implementation roadmap.
>
> **Weeks 1 to 3** — we gather and train. Kick-off meeting with your key people, a baseline questionnaire, a full tech stack review. We also run two AI awareness training sessions. This is important — we want your team to understand what AI can and can't do, so they're part of the solution, not resistant to it.
>
> **Weeks 4 to 7** — we go deep. Department by department. Finance, operations, the aircraft division, procurement, HR. We map every process, identify every bottleneck, and quantify the impact.
>
> **Weeks 8 to 10** — we deliver. A comprehensive AIBA report with strategic recommendations, a prioritised project roadmap, a timeline and budget breakdown, and a 12-week action plan so you know exactly what happens next.
>
> For your business specifically, the AIBA will focus on multi-company consolidation, Whimbrel integration, aircraft maintenance digitisation, and construction operations optimisation. It's not generic — it's built around your constraints.

## SECTION 6 — Investment Options (6:30 – 7:30)

*[Scroll to the Investment Options section]*

> Three options, and they're designed to be sequential — you don't have to commit to everything upfront.
>
> **Option one — the AIBA itself.** R85,000 to R175,000, depending on complexity and scope. This is where I'd recommend starting. It gives you the full picture, the prioritised roadmap, and the business case you need to make informed decisions. No guesswork.
>
> **Option two — Quick Wins Sprint.** Scoped directly from the AIBA findings. We implement the top two or three highest-ROI items in four to eight weeks. This is where you prove value fast.
>
> **Option three — Ongoing Advisory.** R30,000 to R75,000 per month. A fractional Chief AI Officer engagement. Continuous optimisation, system health monitoring, and strategic execution.
>
> I want to be clear — all pricing is indicative and on a time-and-materials basis. We'll provide a detailed statement of work with fixed milestones before anything starts. No surprises.
>
> One thing worth noting on timing: Lisa mentioned you're planning a Pastel cloud migration at the end of March. Before you invest in migrating ten separate Pastel instances to the cloud, it's worth understanding whether consolidating to a single Sage Intacct environment would be more cost-effective and future-proof. The AIBA will give you that clarity.

## SECTION 7 — Close & Next Steps (7:30 – 8:00)

*[Scroll to the Next Steps section]*

> So here's what I'd suggest:
>
> **Step one** — take some time with this document. Discuss it internally. Lisa, Ashley, and Chris can fill in the context from our meeting.
>
> **Step two** — when you're ready, let's schedule a 45-minute discovery call with all decision-makers present. No obligation. We'll answer every question and help you decide if the AIBA is the right next step.
>
> **Step three** — if it makes sense for both sides, we kick off the AIBA. Week one starts with a kick-off meeting and baseline questionnaire. By week ten, you'll have a comprehensive roadmap.
>
> Stuart, directors — I genuinely believe there's a significant opportunity here to transform how Stu Davidson & Sons operates financially. Not by replacing what works, but by making everything around it work better.
>
> My details are on the page. I'm available anytime. Looking forward to the conversation.
>
> Cheers.
