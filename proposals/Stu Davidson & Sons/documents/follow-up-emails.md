## Email 1: Same-Day Follow-Up (13 February 2026)

**Subject:** Great meeting today — recording, summary & next steps inside

**To:** Lisa, Ashley, Chris

Hi Lisa, Ashley, and Chris,

Thank you for a really productive conversation this morning. I appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how the group operates — it is clear that Stu Davidson & Sons has built something impressive over the years, and the Whimbrel system in particular shows real operational maturity.

As promised, here is everything from today's meeting:

- **Meeting recording:** [link]
- **Meeting summary:** [attached — Meeting Recap PDF]
- **Discussion document for directors:** [attached — Proposal PDF]

The discussion document is designed to give your directors a clear, concise overview of what we discussed, the constraints we identified, and the options available — without any pressure or hard sell. It respects the fact that Whimbrel stays and focuses on how we can enhance what you already have.

**Three things I would love your help with:**

1. Could you check with the Whimbrel developers whether APIs are available for integration? This is the single biggest factor in determining how we connect the systems.
2. When you have a moment, could the three of you put together a quick "wish list" — things you wish you could do but currently cannot because of system limitations or time constraints?
3. Once you have had a chance to review the document together, let me know when might be a good time to present to the directors — I am happy to join that meeting if it would be helpful.

No rush on any of this. I know change takes time, and I would rather we get this right than rush it.

Speak soon,

## Email 2: Value-Add (20 February 2026 — 1 Week Later)

**Subject:** Quick thought on the aircraft job cards — found something relevant

Hi Lisa and Ashley,

I have been thinking about the aircraft maintenance challenge you described — the paper-based job cards at the hangar. I came across a case study from a similar operation where digitising maintenance records reduced compliance preparation time by 70% and gave management real-time visibility into aircraft lifecycle costs for the first time.

The interesting part: the mechanics who were initially resistant to the change became the biggest advocates within two weeks because the mobile app was actually faster than filling in paper forms. They could select aircraft, tap through work items, and capture photos — all in less time than writing it out by hand.

I have attached a brief overview of how this could work for your fleet of 15–20 aircraft. It is a standalone project that does not touch Whimbrel or Pastel, so it could serve as a low-risk proof point if the directors want to see results before committing to anything larger.

No pressure — just thought it might be useful context for your conversation with the directors.

How is the Whimbrel API investigation going? Any luck?

Best,

**Dudley Peacock**

## Email 3: Social Proof (27 February 2026 — 2 Weeks Later)

**Subject:** How a similar group consolidated 8 companies into one system

Hi Lisa,

I wanted to share a relevant example that might resonate with your directors. A property and construction group with 8 entities was running separate accounting instances — similar to your 10 Pastel databases. Their month-end close took 3 weeks because of manual intercompany reconciliation and the lack of a consolidated view.

After consolidating onto a single multi-company platform, their month-end close dropped to 5 days. More importantly, the directors could see real-time group performance for the first time — across all entities, on one screen, without waiting for someone to compile a spreadsheet.

The key insight: they did not replace their operational systems. They kept their industry-specific tools (similar to Whimbrel) and connected them to the financial platform via APIs. The operational team barely noticed the change; the finance team got their lives back.

I have attached a one-page summary if it would be useful for your directors' review.

Have you had a chance to discuss the proposal internally? Happy to answer any questions or jump on a quick call if that would help.

Best,

**Dudley Peacock**

## Email 4: Gentle Check-In (6 March 2026 — 3 Weeks Later)

**Subject:** Quick check-in — any questions from the directors?

Hi Lisa,

Just a quick check-in. I know you mentioned that change sometimes takes time, and I completely respect that. I wanted to make sure the discussion document answered the directors' questions and that nothing was unclear.

If it would be helpful, I am happy to:

- **Join a 15-minute call with the directors** to answer any questions directly
- **Provide additional case studies** specific to construction, fleet management, or aircraft operations
- **Run a quick demo** of what the multi-company consolidated view looks like in practice

Alternatively, if the timing is not right, that is perfectly fine too. I would rather stay in touch and be available when you are ready than push for something before the time.

Either way, I hope the Pastel cloud migration testing is going well — I know that was planned for end of March.

Best,

## Email 5: Cost of Inaction Nudge (20 March 2026 — 5 Weeks Later)

**Subject:** A quick calculation I ran for you

Hi Lisa and Ashley,

I was reviewing my notes from our meeting and ran a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation on what the current setup is costing the group. I want to be transparent — these are estimates based on industry benchmarks, not exact figures — but they paint an interesting picture:

| Area | Estimated Monthly Cost |
| :--- | :--- |
| Manual re-keying across 10 Pastel instances | R25,000–R40,000 |
| Data integrity risk and re-work | R15,000–R30,000 |
| Delayed decisions from lack of consolidated view | R20,000–R35,000 |
| Aircraft records compliance risk | R10,000–R20,000 |
| Finance team on data entry vs. analysis | R15,000–R20,000 |
| **Total** | **R85,000–R145,000/month** |

That is roughly **R1–R1.7 million per year** in wasted capacity and risk. The AI Operations Audit (R45,000–R175,000) would pay for itself within the first month if we can address even one of these areas.

I am not trying to create urgency where there is none — but I thought the numbers might be useful context for the directors' decision.

Happy to discuss if any of these figures seem off or if you would like me to refine them with more specific data from your side.

Best,

**Dudley Peacock**

## Email 6: Workshop Invitation (3 April 2026 — 7 Weeks Later)

**Subject:** Free workshop: "Where Does Your Business Break at Scale?" — thought of you

Hi Lisa, Ashley, and Chris,

We are running a free 90-minute workshop next month for finance leaders in construction and related industries. The topic is directly relevant to what we discussed:

**"Where Does Your Business Break at Scale? — Diagnosing Financial Constraints Before They Cost You"**

It covers:
- The four constraint types (capacity, knowledge, process, scale) and how to identify yours
- Why 70% of AI projects fail — and the QDOAA framework that prevents it
- Real case studies from construction, fleet management, and multi-entity operations
- A live Cost of Inaction calculator you can apply to your own business

No sales pitch — just practical frameworks you can use immediately.

**[Register here]** — it is free and there is no obligation.

I thought this might be valuable for your team, and potentially for the directors too. Sometimes hearing from other companies in similar situations helps build confidence in the direction.

Hope to see you there,

**Dudley Peacock**

## Sequence Notes

**Cadence:** Weekly for the first 3 emails, then bi-weekly, then monthly. Do not send more than 6 emails without a response. If no response after Email 6, move to quarterly check-ins with pure value content (industry reports, relevant articles, workshop invitations).

**Personalisation triggers:** If Lisa responds to any email, immediately personalise the next email based on her response. If she mentions the directors' feedback, pivot the sequence to address their specific concerns.

**GHL automation:** All emails should be logged in GoHighLevel with the following tags: `stu-davidson`, `construction`, `plant-hire`, `za-region`, `warm-lead`, `audit-offer`. Set up automated reminders for each send date.

**Escalation:** If the team responds positively to the audit offer, immediately schedule a scoping call and prepare a formal Statement of Work with specific deliverables, timeline, and fixed investment amount within the R45,000–R175,000 range based on scope.
