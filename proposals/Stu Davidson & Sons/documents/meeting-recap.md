## Meeting Purpose

Initial discovery meeting to understand Stu Davidson & Sons' current financial and operational systems, identify constraints, and explore how AI-powered financial management could benefit the group.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Group Structure & Operations

Stu Davidson & Sons operates approximately 12 companies across plant hire and construction (core), an aircraft company (15–20 aircraft — buy/sell, maintenance, charter flights), property companies, directors' capital companies, and a mining operation. The core business runs a fleet of approximately 80 large machines (front-end loaders, crushers, graders, tippers) that are operated on client sites — not leased out. Revenue is charged per hour per machine with wet/dry rates and ground engaging tools. Sales are entirely reputation-driven with no formal sales representatives.

### 2. Current Technology Landscape

The group currently uses **Sage Pastel Partner v19** across 10 separate instances for 10 companies, with no consolidated view. **Whimbrel**, a custom-built operational management system developed over approximately 8 years, handles plant hire operations including machinery tracking, job costing, invoicing, stock management, and workshop management. Whimbrel pushes final invoice amounts to Pastel, with payables integration currently in development. Aircraft maintenance records are entirely paper-based at the hangar.

The team confirmed that **Whimbrel is non-negotiable** — the directors are fully committed to it and consider it a competitive advantage. Any proposed solution must integrate with Whimbrel, not replace it.

### 3. Constraints Identified

**Process Constraint:** Ten separate Pastel instances create fragmented financial management with no consolidated group view, manual intercompany transactions, and a painful year-end process. The team is exploring Pastel cloud migration (planned for end of March) but this alone does not solve the multi-company consolidation challenge.

**Knowledge Constraint:** Aircraft maintenance records, job cards, and service histories are kept on paper at the hangar. This creates vulnerability to knowledge loss, difficulty searching historical records, and challenges with CAA regulatory compliance.

**Scale Constraint:** Pastel Partner v19 is experiencing data integrity issues in the larger company entity, particularly as databases approach the 3–4 GB threshold. Ashley confirmed this is an ongoing concern.

**Capacity Constraint:** Information is scattered across Whimbrel, Pastel, spreadsheets, WhatsApp, and email. The finance team manually re-keys data between systems with no single source of truth for cross-entity reporting.

### 4. AI Discussion

Dudley presented three types of AI that could be layered on top of existing systems:

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Learns repetitive transaction patterns, flags exceptions, automates routine processing
- **Agentic AI:** Searches across all systems to find and synthesise information on demand (e.g., "What was the total maintenance cost for Aircraft ZS-ABC over the last 5 years?")
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Continuously learns and improves business processes; identifies inefficiencies

Chris raised an important question about AI accuracy when dealing with unstructured data (e.g., emails with misspellings). Dudley confirmed a **Human-in-the-Loop** approach where all AI-generated changes require human approval before being applied to production systems.

### 5. Quick Wins Discussed

The team showed particular interest in:
- A **mobile app for aircraft job cards** to replace paper-based records at the hangar
- An **AI layer on Whimbrel** that could answer business intelligence questions across the operational data
- **Multi-company financial consolidation** to replace the 10 separate Pastel instances

Lisa emphasised a pragmatic approach: *"Don't go and build models and whatever yet. Let's just get the basics together."*

## Qualification Assessment

| Signal | Score (1–3) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pain** | 2 | Data integrity issues, paper-based aircraft records, 10 separate systems — real constraints but not an urgent burning platform |
| **Budget** | 1 | No budget discussion; directors control the purse strings; Lisa cautioned against getting ahead of ourselves |
| **Authority** | 1 | Meeting attendees are gatekeepers, not decision makers; directors were absent |
| **Timing** | 2 | Pastel cloud migration planned for end of March; IT running tests — there is a window of opportunity |
| **Total** | **6/12** | Warm lead — proceed with audit offer and nurture sequence |

## Key Quotes

> *"We have had some data integrity issues, particularly in the bigger company."* — Ashley

> *"It's very paper heavy. They don't really have a computerized system for keeping service records."* — Ashley

> *"It's a not negotiable. It will stay. The directors, they stole on it."* — Ashley (regarding Whimbrel)

> *"Change is sometimes slow."* — Lisa

> *"Don't go and build models and whatever yet. Let's just get the basics together."* — Lisa

> *"Getting used to a new computerized system might be a challenge for them."* — Ashley (regarding hangar mechanics)

## Recommended Follow-Up Strategy

Given the qualification score of 6/12, this is a **warm lead** that requires careful nurturing. The directors are the true decision makers and were not present. The strategy should focus on:

1. **Equip the gatekeepers** — give Lisa, Ashley, and Chris everything they need to make a compelling case to the directors
2. **Lead with the audit** — position the AI Operations Audit as a low-risk, high-information starting point (R45,000–R175,000)
3. **Quick-win pilot** — the aircraft job card app is the ideal proof point (small scope, clear ROI, low disruption)
4. **Respect the pace** — Lisa said "change is sometimes slow" — do not push too hard; provide value and let the directors come to the decision
