## SCENE 1: HOOK (0:00 - 0:20)

**[On screen: Dudley speaking to camera, FinanceFlo.AI branded lower third]**

**DUDLEY:**
"If you're a CFO or finance leader running multiple companies on legacy accounting software, and you know AI is transforming everything around you but you're not sure where to start — this video is for you. I'm Dudley Peacock from FinanceFlo.AI, and in the next three minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how we help mid-market businesses integrate AI into their finance operations — without ripping out the systems you already rely on."

## SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:55)

**[On screen: Animated slide showing fragmented systems, spreadsheets, manual processes]**

**DUDLEY:**
"Here's what I see every single day. Finance teams drowning in spreadsheets. Multiple entities consolidated manually. Month-end close taking weeks instead of hours. Your team spending 80% of their time on data entry and reconciliation, and only 20% on the strategic analysis they were actually trained to do.

And here's the thing — your current software vendor is probably telling you to just upgrade to their latest version. But that doesn't solve the fundamental problem. You need a platform that was built from the ground up for multi-company, multi-currency operations — and one that's ready for AI. That's where Sage Intacct and FinanceFlo.AI come in."

## SCENE 3: THE SOLUTION — SAGE INTACCT (0:55 - 1:30)

**[On screen: Sage Intacct dashboard screenshots, multi-entity consolidation view]**

**DUDLEY:**
"Sage Intacct is the number one rated cloud financial management platform for mid-market businesses. It handles multi-entity consolidation in real time, automates intercompany transactions, and gives you dimensional reporting that lets you slice your data any way you need.

But what makes it truly powerful is what's built into the platform: machine learning for anomaly detection, AI-powered accounts payable automation, intelligent general ledger that learns your patterns, and predictive analytics that help you forecast with confidence.

We don't just implement the software. We configure it around your specific business — your chart of accounts, your approval workflows, your reporting requirements. And we integrate it with your existing systems, whether that's Whimbrel, SAP, or any industry-specific platform you're already using."

## SCENE 4: THE ADAPT FRAMEWORK (1:30 - 2:25)

**[On screen: ADAPT Framework overview diagram — animated build]**

**DUDLEY:**
"Now, the software is just the foundation. The real transformation happens through our ADAPT Framework. ADAPT stands for Assess, Design, Automate, Pilot, and Transform.

In the **Assess** phase — that's weeks one and two — we conduct a thorough discovery. We review your current tech stack, map your processes, identify pain points, and score your AI readiness. This gives us a clear picture of where you are and where the biggest opportunities lie.

In the **Design** phase — weeks three and four — we architect the solution. We create an AI opportunity matrix, map out integrations, and build ROI projections so you know exactly what to expect.

**Automate** — weeks five through eight — is where we implement. Platform setup, data migration, AI model training, and workflow automation. This is where the heavy lifting happens.

**Pilot** — weeks nine and ten — we do a controlled rollout. We start with one department, train the users, monitor performance, and collect feedback before scaling.

And finally, **Transform** — week eleven onward — we deploy across the organisation and move into ongoing advisory. This is where I step in as your Fractional Chief AI Officer, ensuring you're continuously optimising and staying ahead of the curve."

## SCENE 5: THE ONGOING ENGAGEMENT (2:25 - 2:50)

**[On screen: Two-track engagement model — Fractional CAIO + Project-based AI]**

**DUDLEY:**
"After the initial engagement, we offer two parallel tracks. First, the Fractional CAIO retainer — that's me embedded in your leadership team on a part-time basis, providing strategic AI guidance, attending your board meetings, and ensuring your AI roadmap stays on track.

Second, project-based AI implementations. These are specific, scoped projects — like building a custom AI assistant for your finance team, automating your aircraft maintenance scheduling, or creating predictive models for your specific industry. Each project delivers measurable ROI, and we tackle them one at a time based on priority."

## SCENE 6: CALL TO ACTION (2:50 - 3:10)
