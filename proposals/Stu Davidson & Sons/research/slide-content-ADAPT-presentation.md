## Slide 2: The Finance Leader's Dilemma
**Heading:** 78% of CFOs say AI will fundamentally reshape finance within 3 years — yet only 12% have a clear implementation strategy
**Key points:**
- Multi-entity businesses are consolidating across spreadsheets, wasting 15+ hours per month-end close
- Legacy accounting platforms (Sage 50, Sage One, QuickBooks) were never designed for AI integration or real-time multi-company reporting
- Finance teams spend 80% of their time on transactional data entry and only 20% on strategic analysis — AI can invert this ratio
- The window to gain competitive advantage through AI in finance is narrowing; early adopters are already seeing 40% reductions in close times and 60% improvements in forecast accuracy

## Slide 6: Phase 1 — ASSESS: Understanding Your Current State
**Heading:** Every successful transformation begins with a thorough, honest assessment of where you are today
**Key points:**
- **Discovery Meeting:** We sit down with your leadership team to understand company structure, AI objectives, organisational culture, and strategic priorities — this is not a software demo, it's a strategic conversation
- **Tech Stack Review:** We audit every system in your finance ecosystem — accounting software, ERP, CRM, spreadsheets, manual processes — and map the data flows between them
- **Pain Point Discovery:** Through interviews with both leadership (top-down) and operational staff (bottom-up), we identify the real bottlenecks, not just the ones management thinks exist
- **AI Readiness Score:** We deliver a quantified readiness score across 5 dimensions: Data Quality, Process Maturity, Technology Infrastructure, People & Skills, and Strategic Alignment
- **Deliverable:** Preliminary Assessment Report with recommended next steps and indicative ROI
**Visual style:** Left column shows the assessment activities as a vertical flow, right side shows a sample AI Readiness Score radar chart with the 5 dimensions.

## Slide 7: Phase 2 — DESIGN: Architecting Your Solution
**Heading:** We design solutions that respect your existing investments while unlocking transformative AI capabilities
**Key points:**
- **Process Mapping:** Every finance workflow is documented — from purchase order to payment, from invoice to revenue recognition — identifying automation opportunities at each step
- **AI Opportunity Matrix:** We score each process against AI readiness, business impact, and implementation complexity to create a prioritised roadmap (quick wins first, strategic projects later)
- **Integration Blueprint:** Detailed technical architecture showing how Sage Intacct connects with your existing systems (e.g., Whimbrel for industry-specific operations, CRM for customer data, payroll systems)
- **ROI Projections:** Conservative, realistic, and optimistic scenarios with payback period calculations — we only recommend projects that deliver measurable returns
- **Deliverable:** Solution Design Document with architecture diagrams, integration specifications, and phased implementation plan
**Visual style:** Architecture diagram showing Sage Intacct at centre connected to surrounding systems, with AI layer on top. Green connecting lines on dark background.

## Slide 8: Phase 3 — AUTOMATE: Building and Implementing
**Heading:** Implementation is where strategy becomes reality — we handle the heavy lifting so your team can focus on running the business
**Key points:**
- **Platform Setup:** Sage Intacct configuration including chart of accounts, entity structure, dimensional reporting, approval workflows, and user roles — tailored to your specific business, not a generic template
- **Data Migration:** Clean, validated migration from legacy systems with full audit trail — we handle the data cleansing, mapping, and parallel running to ensure zero disruption
- **AI Model Training:** Custom AI models trained on your historical data — anomaly detection tuned to your transaction patterns, forecasting models calibrated to your business cycles, AP automation trained on your vendor invoices
- **Workflow Automation:** End-to-end automation of repetitive processes — bank reconciliation, intercompany eliminations, expense approvals, revenue recognition — freeing your team for strategic work
- **Deliverable:** Fully configured platform with trained AI models, documented processes, and parallel running results
**Visual style:** Four implementation workstreams shown as parallel tracks with progress indicators. Dark background, green progress bars.

## Slide 9: Phase 4 — PILOT: Controlled Launch and Validation
**Heading:** We start small, prove the value, and build momentum before scaling across the organisation
**Key points:**
- **Department Rollout:** We select one department or entity as the pilot — typically the one with the highest pain and the most receptive team — to demonstrate quick wins and build internal champions
- **User Training:** Hands-on training sessions (not just manuals) tailored to each user role — from the CFO dashboard to the AP clerk's daily workflow — ensuring adoption from day one
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time KPI tracking comparing pilot results against baseline — close time reduction, error rates, processing speed, user satisfaction — with weekly review meetings
- **Feedback Loops:** Structured feedback collection from every user level, feeding directly into configuration refinements and AI model retraining before full rollout
- **Deliverable:** Pilot Results Report with validated KPIs, user feedback summary, and go/no-go recommendation for full deployment
**Visual style:** Before/after comparison metrics displayed as gauges or bar charts. Pilot department highlighted in green, other departments in grey awaiting rollout.

## Slide 10: Phase 5 — TRANSFORM: Scale, Optimise, and Lead
**Heading:** Transformation is not a project with an end date — it's an ongoing commitment to staying ahead of the curve
**Key points:**
- **Full Deployment:** Systematic rollout across all entities and departments, leveraging lessons learned from the pilot to accelerate adoption and minimise risk
- **Continuous AI Learning:** Your AI models don't stop improving after go-live — they continuously learn from new data, becoming more accurate and more valuable over time
- **Strategic Advisory:** As your Fractional CAIO, I join your leadership conversations, attend board meetings, and ensure your AI strategy evolves with your business strategy
- **Ongoing Support:** Regular health checks, quarterly business reviews, platform optimisation, and priority access to new AI capabilities as they become available
- **Deliverable:** Quarterly AI Strategy Review, ongoing platform optimisation, and continuous improvement roadmap
**Visual style:** Upward trajectory arrow showing continuous improvement, with quarterly milestones marked. Fractional CAIO engagement model shown as an embedded role.
