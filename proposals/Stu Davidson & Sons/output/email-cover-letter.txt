Subject: Great meeting — your AI Business Analysis discussion document

---

Hi Lisa, Ashley, and Chris,

Thank you again for such a productive and open conversation. I genuinely appreciated the transparency — it's rare to walk into a meeting where everyone is so honest about both what's working and what isn't. That tells me a lot about the culture at Stu Davidson & Sons, and it made this document much more useful as a result.

I've put together a discussion document for the directors that captures everything we covered:

- The four constraints we identified (data integrity, paper-based aviation records, no consolidated view, and change management)
- A conservative estimate of what the status quo is costing the group (R85K–R145K/month)
- Three engagement options — starting with the AI Business Analysis (AIBA) at R85K–R175K
- A clear three-step path forward with no obligation at any stage

Attached: The full proposal as a PDF — designed to be printed or shared digitally.

Online version: I've also built an interactive version with all the same content, which may be easier to share with the directors:

Video walkthrough: I've recorded a short personal video (8 min) walking through the proposal — I'd recommend watching this before sharing with the directors:

I want to be clear: there is no pressure here. This document respects the fact that Whimbrel stays — our approach is to enhance what you already have, not replace it. And I know change takes time. I'd rather we get this right than rush it.

When you're ready, here are three ways to continue the conversation:

- Quick 30-minute call: https://book.vimcal.com/p/dudleypeacock/30-minute-meeting-f8337
- 60-minute director review: https://book.vimcal.com/p/dudleypeacock/60-minute-meeting-D158w
- 2-hour scoping workshop: https://book.vimcal.com/p/dudleypeacock/scoping-workshop-2-hours

One last thought — you mentioned the Pastel cloud migration planned for end of March. Before committing to migrating 10 separate instances to the cloud, it may be worth exploring whether consolidating to a single platform would be more cost-effective. The AIBA would give you that clarity before you make that decision.

Looking forward to hearing from you. No rush at all.

Warm regards,
